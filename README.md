# What is AocDateLib?
AocDateLib is a efficent way for ***manage dates in C++***. It's based on the C/C++ time library for create dates and timestamps.
I've created this library because I think that the way in which we can work with dates in the time library is difficult to understand at first impact and it's not very intuitive. In addition this library allow take advantage from C++ functionalities(ex. classes) at the best. 
Well... It sounds interesting!! So let's going to explore this library!!

<br>

# Starting With AocDateLib

Well, we are ready to start working with AocDateLib, first of all let me tell you how to use it in the next subsection.
  
  
  
## How to use it

AocDateLib is entirely developed in C++, especially **C++20**. So to use it, we need to include the AocDateLib header file in our project, so depending on the operating system we are using, **we need to compile by linking the dynamic library** (.ddl or .so). I don't give the static library but it is easy to get it if you have minimal knowledge in C++ and on how static and dynamic libraries work.
Let's see an example of how to use the Dynamic library for compile our program. In this example we will use g++ compiler:

```
g++ -std=c++20 -c mymainfile.cpp
g++ -o myprogram mymainfile.o AocDateLib.so
./myprogram
```
> **It's important to compile in C++20 for the correct functioning of the library, in g++ compiler the flag for do this is ```-std=c++20``` but can change dipendently from the compiler.**

A more in-depth guide can be found at [this link](https://domiyanyue.medium.com/c-development-tutorial-4-static-and-dynamic-libraries-7b537656163e).

<br>

## Assumptions
throughout this documentation we will refer to some **keywords** regarding the library.
List these below:
- ***Error Date object*** --> This object is a Date corrisponding to **1/01/1900**. It will be returned when the desired date is not considered valid or when certain operations are not possible on it.
- **Limits of the library** --> this is not precisely a keyword but It's good immediately illustrate the limitations of the library in terms of date management. The minimum valid date is **1/01/1900 00:00:00** while the maximum valid date is, on 64bit Windows, **31/12/2999 23:59:59** while on other operating systems is **31/12/2037 23:59:59** due to the limitations of the time library and the lack of support for higher dates on unix like systems. I am not ruling out that an update to the library may arrive in the future that adds this support.


## Ready?
So , after this brief two sections we are ready to start with this library, Good luck!!

<br>
<br>

# The Date class
The Date class is the heart of this library. this class is what we create and manage our dates with. Let's not get lost in small talk and let's see now how to best use it to create our dates.

<br>

## Create dates
AocDateLib provides different ways for create dates. First of all we must obviusly create a new Date object:
```cpp
Date new_date{}; //new Date object that calls default constructor
```
This statement creates a new Date object calling the default constructor of the class. This constructor sets the date to the current date, in fact we can
output the date simply using on it the `<<` operator:
```cpp
Date new_date{};
std::cout << new_date << std::endl; //outputs the current date
```
Obviusly this isn't the only way for create dates, we can use other 2 ways:
 - We can create dates manually specifing all time datas(year, month, day, hour, minute, second):
 ```cpp
 Date custom_date{2022, 03, 27, 22, 32, 48};
 std::cout << custom_date << std::endl; //outputs: 27/03/2022 22:32:48
 ```
 We can omit last three values(hour, minute, second), in this case they assume the value 0 by default
 - We can create dates form a string:
 ```cpp
 Date string_date{"21/07/2007"}; // hour, minute and second become 0 by default
 std::cout << string_date << std::endl; //outputs: 21/07/2007 00:00:00
 ```
 We can give to constructor either a std::string object or a c-like string.
 
> Note that if a time value or string is invalid, the date become a [***Error Date object***](#assumptions).

There is another important functionality: We can pass to constructor for string dates a second parameter that specifies the format of the string date:
```cpp
Date fstring_date{"07/21/2007", "%m/%d/%Y"}; //creates a string date in the format: month/day/year
Date fstring_date2{"07/21/2007 00:00:00", "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S"}; //format: month/day/year hour:minute:second
```
The format qualifiers are:
- `%d` for day
- `%m` for month
- `%Y` for year
- `%H` for hour
- `%M` for minute
- `%S` for second

**Other qualifiers will simply be ignored.**

In addition we can use other separators for the date string and the format string, these don't have to be the same, they can even be mixed.
Accepted separators are: ' ', /, -, ., :  This is an example:
```cpp
Date d2{"07-21-2007 00:00-00", "%m-%d-%Y %H:%M-%S"};
std::cout << d2 << std::endl;
```
Note that when a format string isn't specified , the **default format** is `%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S` therefore different separators aren't accepted and they will simply be ignored throwing a Date Error 3. For use different separators/qualifiers **we must specify the string format**:
```cpp
Date d1{"21-07-2007"}; //Invalid date, string not match her default format part: %d/%m/%Y 
Date d2{"21/07/2007"}; //OK
Date d3{"21-07-2007", "%d-%m-%Y"}; //OK
Date d4{"07/21.2007 00-00:00", "%m-%d/%Y %H-%M:%S"}; //Invalid date, string not match the format(different separators)
Date d5{"07-21-2007", "%m-%d-%Y %H.%M.%S"}; //OK, the part of the string match the her format part(07-21-2007 with %m-%d-%Y)

```

> ***Note that the date output will automatically assume the format specified in initialization if one has been specified, otherwise the default will be adopted: `%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S`***

> ***The format can't be changed after date initizialization***

> ***IMPORTANT: The format of the current date created with the default constructor and the format for an Error Date object can't be speicified, the default will be adopted: `%d/%m/%Y %H/%M/%S`***

> ***For get the format of a date we can use the membrer function `get_format()`***


**Let's see an example that summarize everything we said:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include "AocDateLib.h"

int main() {
  Date new_date{2021, 1, 1}; //date 1/01/2021 00:00:00, default format
  Date new_date1{2021, 02, 1, 0, 0, 0, "%m-%d-%Y %H.%M.%S"}; //date 02-1-2021 00.00.00 , custom format
  
  Date d1{}, d2{"21/07/2007"}; //current date and custom string date, match with default format
  Date d3{"21-07-2007 20.45.12", "%d-%m-%Y %H.%M.%S"}; //the same date 20h 45m 12s after, match the custom format
  Date d4{"08:21:2007 00 00 00"}; //same date 1 day after. This don't match de default format, DATE ERROR 3, date become 1/01/1900 00:00:00
  
  std::string date_str{"21-07-2007"}, format_str{"%d-%m-%Y"};
  Date d5{date_str, format_str}; //date 21-07-2007 with custom format. With std::string objects
  
  std::cout << d5 << std::endl; //outputs: 21-07-2007
  return 0;
}
```

> ***Note that in the last case the custom format specifies only the day, month and year therefore it will not be possible to print the other data as well. For this reason I always recommend using a complete format string.***

> ***For checking if a date string is valid we can use the static function `check_date_string`, this accepts two parameters, the string and the (optional)format that by default will be `%d/%m/%Y %H/%M/%S`***
```cpp
std::string date;
std::cin >> date;
if(!Date::check_date_string(date)) std::cout << "Invalid date" << std::endl;
```
> ***Note that is also considered an invalid date `1/01/1900` as it indicates a [Error Date object](#assumptions)***

## Getting and setting date informations

after creating a date we could want to getting the time values for using these in expressions , for example, for compare the day of a date with that of another. Well, AocDateLib provides , for each time value a getter member function (of the Date class). These are listed follow:
- `get_year()` --> returns the year
- `get_mon()`  --> returns the month
- `get_day()`  --> returns the day
- `get_hour()` --> returns the hour
- `get_min()`  --> returns the minute
- `get_sec()`  --> returns the second
- `get_ts()`   --> returns the timestamp of the date(negative for dates before 1/01/1970)

Let's see this functions in the following snippet:
```cpp
Date new_date{}; //initzialize the Date object with the current day
unsigned int day{new_date.get_day()}, mon{new_date.get_mon()};
if(day > 14) std::cout << "The second week of the current month is passed" << std::endl;
if(mon > 6) std::cout << You've passed the half of the year" << std::endl;
```


Obviulsy we would also can modify the time values such as the day or the year. Well , AocDateLib provide for each time value a setter member function too. These are listed follwing:
- `set_year(unsigned int year)`   --> set the year to `year`
- `set_mon(unsigned int month)`   --> set the month to `month`
- `set_day(unsigned int day)`     --> set the day to `day`
- `set_hour(unsigned int hour)`   --> set the hour to `hour`
- `set_min(unsigned int minute)`  --> set the minute to `minute`
- `set_sec(unsigned int second)`  --> set the second to `second`
- `set_now()` --> set the date to the current date

If the value given to the setter is invalid , an DATE ERROR 2 is thrown and the date keep the same.
```cpp
Date new_date{"21/07/2007"};
new_date.set_day(29);
std::cout << new_date << std::endl; //outputs: 29/07/2007 00:00:00
new_date.set_sec(90); //DATE ERROR 3, invalid value, 90 isn't a valid value for second
```

<br>

## Dates with comparison operators
AocDateLib support all comparison operators(`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`) on Date objects in two different ways:
- Date to Date, comparing two dates objects:
```cpp
Date d1{"21/07/2007"}, d2{"01/01/2000"};
if(d1 < d2) std::cout << "You were born before 2000" << std::endl;
else std::cout << "You was born after 2000" << std::endl;

if(d2 != d1) std::cout << "You weren't born on 01/01/2000" << std::endl;
```
- Date to date string, for comparing Date object with a date string:
```cpp
Date d1{"21/07/2007"};
if(d1 == "21/07/2007") std::cout << "You were born on 21st July 2007" << std::endl;
```

> ***Note that the date string will take the same format of the Date object compared***

> ***Note that if the date string is invalid this will be treated as if it were an [Error Date object](#assumptions)***

<br>

## Dates with arithmetic operators

AocDateLib also supports some arithmetic operators(`+`, `-`, `+=`, `-=`). We can use this operators for adding/substructing a time value from a given date. The `date_literals` namespace defines the literals corrisponding to all time values, in particulary:
- `_y`  --> literal that identifies a year(especially a period of 365 days)
- `_m`  --> literal that identifies a month(especially a period of 30 days)
- `_d`  --> literal that identifies a day
- `_h`  --> literal that identifies an hour
- `_M`  --> literal that identifies a minute
- `_s`  --> literal that identifies a second

We just have to add the value corrisponding to the specified literals for add/subtruct a valid time value:

```cpp
using namespace date_literals;

//adds 2 years to the date
Date d{"21/07/2007"};
d += 2_y;
std::cout << d << std::endl; //outputs: 20/07/2007 00:00:00, (2008 is bissextile)
Date new_date{d + 20_d + 2_h};
std::cout << days << std::endl; //outputs: 10/08/2007 02:00:00
```

> ***Note that if the resulting date is invalid the date automatically becomes an [Error Date object](#assumptions)***

> ***!!!IMPORTANT!!! for timestamp issues do operations on dates before 01/01/1970 isn't possible, this causes the behavior described above***


# Working with Date arrays
AocDateLib also provides some utility functions for working with Date objects arrays, these functions are defined in the `date_array` namespace.
This namespace is constantly evolving, so new features will be added soon. All these functions accepts and an `std::span<>` container to allow functions to work with any main kind of array(c-style arrays, `std::vector<>` containers, `std::array<>` containers and `std::span<>` containers)
- `size_t get_min(const std::span<const Date>&& date_arr, const size_t s_index = 0)` --> returns the index corresponding to the minumum Date in the array
- `size_t get_max(const std::span<const Date>&& date_arr, const size_t s_index = 0)` --> returns the index corresponding to the maximum Date in the array
- `size_t find_date(const std::span<const Date>&& date_arr, const Date &date, const size_t s_index = 0)` --> returns the index corresponding to the first element in the array equal to the Date object passed
- `size_t find_date(const std::span<const Date>&& date_arr, const std::string& string_date, const size_t s_index = 0, const std::string format = "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")` --> overload of `find_date` above. Indeed of the Date object, this uses a date_string for searching the date. We also can specify the format of the date string. If nothing is specified the default format will be applied.
- `std::vector<Date> get_dates(const std::span<Date>&& date_arr, const size_t year, const size_t month = npos, const size_t day = npos, const size_t hour = npos, const size_t minute = npos, const size_t second = npos, const size_t s_index = 0)` --> returns a `std::vector<>` container within Date objects that match the given parameters. We've need to specify at least the year. In this case the function returns a `std::vector` within all Date objects with year equal to the passed value.
Note that all functions accept a default parameter index that specifies the starting index for the function.

> ***the default value for not specifying a time parameter is the constant `npos`, defined in `date_array` namespace***

> ***In the case of find_date functions , `npos` will be returned if there isn't a Date object equal to the one passed(Date object/date string)***

Let's see an example:
```cpp
std::vector<Date> date_vect;
do{
  std::string new_string_date;
  bool is_valid{true};
  do {
    std::cout << "Insert date: ";
    std::cin >> new_string_date;
    if(!is_valid) std::cout << "Invalid date" << std::endl;
  } while(!is_valid);
  date_vect.push(Date{new_string_date});
  std::cout << "Continue? ";
  char ch;
  std::cin >> ch;
} while(ch != 'n');
std::cout << "Min date: " << date_vect.at(date_array::get_min(date_vect)) << std::endl;
std::cout << "Max date: " << date_vect.at(date_array::get_max(date_vect)) << std::endl;
Date to_find{"21/07/2007"};
unsigned int index{date_array::find_date(date_vect, to_find)};
if(index != date_array::npos) std::cout << "Date found at position: " << index << std::endl;
std::vector selected_dates{date_array::get_dates(date_vect, 2000)};
std::cout << "Dates in 2000 are: " << std::endl;
for(auto x : selected_dates) std::cout << x << std::endl;
```
<br>
<br>

# Errors
For now, AocDateLib provides three errors, these are listed following:
  - ***DATE ERROR 1, INVALID STRING DATE*** --> this error says that the string date passed to a constructor (or functions that require this) is invalid.
  - ***DATE ERROR 2, INVALID TIME VALUE*** --> this error says that the time value passed to setter functions is invalid.
  - ***DATE ERROR 3, DATE STRING NOT MATCH FORMAT STRING*** --> this error says that the string date passed to a constructor don't match the format string specified.
